Bayesian Modelling and Predictive Analytics for Real-World Data
– Objective: To apply Bayesian inference for solving real-world problems where uncertainty and data sparsity are critical, such as predicting linguistic processing delays, modeling cognitive load from pupil-size data, and decision-making under limited samples.
– Approach: Implemented Bayesian regression and hierarchical models in R using brms and rstan, with posterior estimation via MCMC and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Conducted model comparison using Bayes Factors, LOO-
CV, and k-fold validation with the bridgesampling and loo packages.
– Result: Achieved accurate posterior predictions and robust hypothesis testing in datasets involving language comprehension, behavioral responses, and cognitive experiments. Demonstrated strong skills in probabilistic modeling, predictive analytics, uncertainty quantification, and scientific data visualization (ggplot2).
